# Tesla Landing Page Clone

This is a landing page build mimicing the Tesla website.

**Libraries and packages**:

- React
- Redux
- Styled-components
- React Reveal
- and a few more

_It can be rightly argued that use of redux was unnecessary, but the purpose was to test out the reduxjs-toolkit method._
_The inspiration to build the site was from Clever Programmar_
